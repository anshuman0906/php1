	<div id="text2">A vision that first came to Dr. Naresh Trehan, while practising surgery at the NYU Medical Center in the USA. For every 1000 Indian patients he treated there, another 1000 couldn't 
	even afford to fly down. That's when he realised that India needed to have an advance multispecialty medical institution of its own. An institution which not only treats, but trains and innovates too,
	while providing international standards of technology, infrastructure, clinical care, and a fusion of traditional Indian and modern medicine.
All at one-tenth the cost.</div>

<h1><u>Unbiased and Comprehensive Evaluation</u></h1>
Health care could not advance without constant study, trial, and implementation. When and where the practice of medicine
 becomes arrogant and dictatorial, innovation takes a back seat. Individual physicians, health systems, universities and other 
 healthcare providers may or may not be restrained by a sense of parochialism or institutional bias, thereby knowingly or unknowingly
 limiting access to various treatment options or approaches to providing quality care.
<p>MediCounsel.com is dedicated to empowering your health care decision making process. To let you live well with terminal or chronic disease
 requires unbiased and comprehensive evaluation of your specific condition. Your situation is discussed among our medical professionals and their

 and cons of each course of action with the sole purpose of empowering you to make an informed decision armed with the best information available.</p>
